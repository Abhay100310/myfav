        <p> Shivaji Rao Gaekwad (born 12 December 1950), known professionally as Rajinikanth, is an Indian actor who works primarily in Tamil cinema.
           <br>
            In addition to acting, he has also worked as a producer and screenwriter. He has won many awards, including four Tamil Nadu State Film Best Actor Awards and a Filmfare Best Tamil Actor Award.
        <br>
            The Government of India has honored him with the Padma Bhushan (2000) and the Padma Vibhushan (2016).
         <br>   
            He received the Chevalier Sivaji Ganesan Award for Excellence in Indian Cinema at the 4th Vijay Awards.
            <br>
            At the 45th International Film Festival of India (2014), he was conferred with the "Centenary Award for Indian Film Personality of the Year".
            <br>
            At the 50th edition of the International Film Festival of India (2019), he was honoured with the Icon of Global Jubilee award.
           <br> 
            He is the second-highest grossing actor in Tamil cinema history, behind veteran M. G. Ramachandran.
           <br>
            Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama Apoorva Raagangal, Rajinikanth's acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films.
            <br>
            The Suresh Krissna-directed Baashha (1995) in which Rajinikanth played a crime boss, was a major commercial success in his career and earned him a 'god-like' status in Tamil Nadu.
            <br>
            Sivaji (2007) was the third Indian film to enter the 100 Crore Club.[7] After earning ₹26 crore (equivalent to ₹63 crore or US$8.9 million in 2019) for his role in Sivaji, Rajinikanth received his career best highest salary at the time. He played dual roles, as a scientist and an andro-humanoid robot, in the science fiction film Enthiran (2010) and its sequel 2.0 (2018), both being India's most expensive production at the time of their release, and among the one of highest-grossing Indian films of all time. </p>

  <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end,
      each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
      The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets),
      while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").
      Means of dismissal include being bowled
      , when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails,
      and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat,
      but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.
      When ten batters have been dismissed,
      the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
      The game is adjudicated by two umpires,
      aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
      They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.
    <br>
    <br>
    Forms of cricket range from Twenty20,
      with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs,
      to Test matches played over five days.
      Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit,
      but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours.
      In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard,
      solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
